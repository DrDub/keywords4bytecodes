Learners
-New algorithms added in the meta package.
-EnsembleOfClassifierChains: The final confidences can now be computed not only by averaging votes, but also by averaging confidences. The option of sampling with replacement was added.
-MMP: updated with loss functions. Added possibility to specify number of training epochs for MMPLearner.
-BinaryRelevance: Added method to get the model built for a label.
-Update to the lazy package: Euclidean is still the default distance function, the option to use a different distance function is given.

Measures
-Introduced loss functions package.
-Refurbished the measures package so that the measure hierarchy has cleaner semantics and takes loss functions into consideration.
-Strict/nostrict evaluation (handles divisions by zero differently).
-Uniform calculation of f-measure for all related measures.

Bug fixes
-Bug fix in the dimensionality reduction package.
-Bug fix in CalibratedLabelRanking class.
-Updated design and bug fixes in thresholding strategies.
-Fixed defect in MMPUniformUpdateRule.
-Bug fix in the getPriors method.
-Javadoc comment updates.

API changes
-Upgrade to Weka 3.7.3.

Experiments
-Experiment from ICTAI 2010 paper added.

Examples
-Simplified source examples for consistency with the online documentation.
-Added an example that shows storing/loading a multi-label model.

Unit Tests
-HOMER and HMC tests added.
-MetaLabeler and ThresholdPrediction test updated.
